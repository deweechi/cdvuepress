::: slot aboutme
Hello, my name is Chip DeWeese. Thank you for visiting my corner on the web. I am a Web developer with over 25 years of IT experience. I have done work for multiple companies including: JPMORGANCHASE, Mars, Blue Cross Blue Shield and DuPont. I love working with the Jamstack. I have worked with React and Angular but Vue is my preference.

I love woodworking, particularly wood turning. Having multiple outlets for expressing creativity helps keep me away from the computer chair.

In December 2004 I was diagnosed with stage 2 colon cancer. After surgery and some chemotherapy, I count myself as a 15+ year survivor. I had cancer, but cancer never had me! My scars are proof that I was stronger than cancer and I won.

I built this site using VuePress and Vuetify. The hero image at the top is from unsplash. I host the site on AWS Amplify. This makes it simple to rebuild/deploy without jumping through a lot of hoops. The content for this page is contained in a markdown file. Where needed items are put into variables and larger parts of the content are broken into named slots.

This allows for great flexibility. All of this is then stored in a GitHub repository. I can make changes preview them locally and then sync the repo. Once the repo gets updated it triggers AWS Amplify to rebuild.

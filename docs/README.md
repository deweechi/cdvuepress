::: slot aboutme
Hello, my name is Chip DeWeese. Thank you for visiting my corner on the web. I am a Web consultant with over 25 years of IT experience. I have done work for multiple companies including JPMORGANCHASE, Mars, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and DuPont. I love working with the Jamstack. I have worked with React and Angular but Vue is my current preference.

I love woodworking, particularly woodturning. Having another outlet for expressing creativity helps keep me from being in the computer chair full time.

In December 2004 I was diagnosed with stage 2 colon cancer. I am a survivor. I like to participate in charitable events that raise money for cancer centered organizations. I have spoken about my experience at these events and I like to donate my woodworking for fundraising raffles. I had cancer, but cancer never had me! My scars are proof that I was stronger than cancer and I won.

My wife and I are currently looking to relocate back down to the Delaware area. If you know of an opportunity in that area I would love to hear from you!

I built this site using VuePress and Vuetify. The hero image at the top is from unsplash. I host the site on AWS Amplify. This makes it simple to rebuild/deploy without jumping through a lot of hoops. The content for this page is contained in a markdown file. Where needed items are put into variables and larger parts of the content are broken into named slots.

This allows for great flexibility. All of this is then stored in a GitHub repository. I can make changes preview them locally and then sync the repo. Once the repo gets updated it triggers AWS Amplify to rebuild.
